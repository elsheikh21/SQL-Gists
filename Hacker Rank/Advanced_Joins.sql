-- 1. Projects
-- Write a query to output the start and end dates of projects listed by the number of days it took to complete the project in ascending order.
-- If there is more than one project that have the same number of completion days, then order by the start date of the project.
-- If the End_Date of the tasks are consecutive, then they are part of the same project.
-- Samantha is interested in finding the total number of different projects completed.
